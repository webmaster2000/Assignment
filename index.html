    My goal for attending the web development class could be itemised under the following.
   <div>
    <p>1.There is such a high demand for web developers and so little trained developers to fill those positions, 
    <p>tech companies are doing an excellent job at making work like very comfortable,</p> 
    <p>if not enjoyable. If you choose to work for a tech company as a web developer,</p>
     you all enjoy free food, ping pong, and rad coworkers. 
   </p>
   <p>2.Web development gives you the opportunity to express yourself creatively on the internet.</p>
    <p>If you have an idea you would like to try as you discover your web dev skills, try it out.</p>
    <p>Web dev is a fun, creative experience.Deciding a career will always be a difficult decision,</p> especially when you’re unsure of what the outcome will be after you’ve invested time and money into learning a new trade. 
   <p>Fortunately, the high demand, easy-to-learn, fun-to-experience life of a web developer is always a great choice for someone ready to have an exciting career in code.</p>
