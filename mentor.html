            Thérèse was the youngest of nine children, five of whom survived childhood.
            After her mother died of breast cancer in 1877, Thérèse moved with her family to Lisieux. In the deeply
            religious atmosphere of her home, her piety developed early and intensively. All four of her elder
            sisters
            became nuns, and at the age of 15 she entered the Carmelite convent at Lisieux, having been refused
            admission a year earlier. Although she suffered from depression, scruples—a causeless feeling of
            guilt—and,
            at the end, religious doubts, she kept the rule to perfection and maintained a smiling, pleasant, and
            unselfish manner. Before her death from tuberculosis, she acknowledged that, because of her
            difficult
            nature, not one day had ever passed without a struggle. Her burial site at Lisieux became a place of
            pilgrimage, and a basilica bearing her name was built there (1929–54).
            The story of Thérèse’s spiritual development was related in a collection of her epistolary essays,
            written by order of the prioresses and published in 1898 under the title Histoire d’une âme (“Story of a
            Soul”).
            Her popularity is largely a result of this work, which conveys her loving pursuit of holiness in
            ordinary
            life. St. Thérèse defined her doctrine of the Little Way as “the way of spiritual childhood, the way of
            trust and absolute surrender.”
            She was canonized by Pope Pius XI in 1925 and was the youngest person to be designated a doctor of the
            church.<a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Saint-Therese-of-Lisieux">More</a>
